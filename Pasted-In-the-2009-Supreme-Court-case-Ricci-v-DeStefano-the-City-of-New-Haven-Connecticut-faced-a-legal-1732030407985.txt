In the 2009 Supreme Court case Ricci v. DeStefano, the City of New Haven, Connecticut, faced a legal challenge after discarding the results of promotional exams for firefighters. The decision to nullify the test outcomes was based on concerns that minority candidates had scored disproportionately lower than white candidates, potentially exposing the city to claims of racial discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
Background
In 2003, the New Haven Fire Department administered promotional exams to identify candidates for lieutenant and captain positions. The results revealed that white candidates had a higher pass rate compared to minority candidates:
•	White candidates passing: 58%
•	Black candidates passing: 32%
•	Hispanic candidates passing: 20%
Concerned about the potential for disparate impact lawsuits due to these disparities, the city chose to invalidate the exam results. In response, a group of firefighters who had performed well on the exams, predominantly white and including one Hispanic, filed a lawsuit alleging that the city's action constituted reverse discrimination in violation of Title VII.
Statistical Analysis
The "four-fifths rule" is a guideline used to assess potential adverse impact in employment practices. According to this rule, a selection rate for any racial, ethnic, or gender group that is less than 80% (four-fifths) of the rate for the group with the highest rate may indicate discrimination.The four-fifths rule, also known as the 80% rule, is a guideline used to assess potential adverse impact in employment practices. It suggests that a selection rate for any racial, ethnic, or gender group that is less than 80% (four-fifths) of the rate for the group with the highest selection rate may indicate discriminatory effects.
Development of the Four-Fifths Rule
The four-fifths rule was first introduced by the Technical Advisory Committee on Testing (TACT), formed by the State of California Fair Employment Practice Commission (FEPC) in 1971. TACT published the State of California Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures in October 1972, marking the first official documentation of the 80% test in the context of adverse impact. This concept was later incorporated into the 1978 Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures, a document utilized by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), Department of Labor, and Department of Justice in Title VII enforcement.

Applying this rule to the exam results:
•	Black candidates' pass rate relative to white candidates: 32% / 58% ≈ 55%
•	Hispanic candidates' pass rate relative to white candidates: 20% / 58% ≈ 34%
Both percentages fall below the 80% threshold, suggesting a potential adverse impact on minority candidates.
Supreme Court Decision
The Supreme Court, in a 5-4 decision, ruled in favor of the firefighters who challenged the city's decision to discard the test results. The Court held that New Haven's action violated Title VII's prohibition against disparate treatment. The majority opinion stated that before an employer can engage in intentional discrimination for the purpose of avoiding or remedying an unintentional disparate impact, there must be a "strong basis in evidence" to believe that it will be subject to disparate-impact liability if it fails to take the race-conscious action. In this case, the Court found that New Haven did not have such a strong basis in evidence.

Implications
The Ricci v. DeStefano decision has significant implications for employment law and affirmative action policies. It underscores the complexity employers face when attempting to balance the avoidance of disparate impact with the prohibition against disparate treatment. The ruling emphasizes that employers must have substantial evidence of potential disparate-impact liability before making employment decisions based on race to avoid reverse discrimination claims.
